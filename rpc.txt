 a remote procedure call occurs in the following steps:
1. The client procedure calls the client stub in the normal way.
2. The client stub builds a message and calls the local operating system.
3. The client’s OS sends the message to the remote OS.
4. The remote OS gives the message to the server stub.
-- at this point the client stub calls receive() and blocks for the response
5. The server stub unpacks the parameters and calls the server.
6. The server does the work and returns the result to the stub.
7. The server stub packs it in a message and calls its local OS.
8. The server’s OS sends the message to the client’s OS.
9. The client’s OS gives the message to the client stub.
10. The stub unpacks the result and returns to the client.
